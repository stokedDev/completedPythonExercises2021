# def tells python that you are going to make a function
# then give function a name
# separate words in variable names and function names with underscore
# any code inside the function needs to be indented
# inside a function you can have as many lines of code as you want
# you can have as many parameters as you want
# parameters are the comma separated variables passed into a function
# you can pass any kind of data to a function and it will work; strings, numbers, booleans, arrays
# generally it's a good idea to break your code into different functions
# when you have a group of code that's working on the same result, that's a good candidate for a function


# def say_hi(name, age):
#     print("Hello " + name + ", you are " + str(age) + ".")
#
#
# say_hi("Mo", 28)
