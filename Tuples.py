coordinates = (2, 5)  # tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets
# tuples are basically lists that can't be modified in any way
# I'll probably use lists more often than tuples
# you can make a list of tuples like I did directly below

# use tuples when you are working with data that shouldn't change
